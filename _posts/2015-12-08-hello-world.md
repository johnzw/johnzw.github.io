For the sake of tradition, I named my first Jekyll blog "Hello Wolrd". This seems sort of nerdy. Although it is the least impression I wanted to make, I can't think of anything more appropriate than this. Because I completely nerd the shit out of this. it looks like trophy to me. If I just abandoned what I have done to gain achievement, I would be ashamed of myself. Besides, "Hello World" doesn't hurt much, does it...

I think it is nesscessary to illustrate why I built this blog. I have built a lot of blogs before, appengine-based-crap, wordpress, and anything other than geeky shit. Sometimes, I built blog because I want to record something. Somtimes, I built blog for fun. And this time, you don't even need to guess. I built this just because Jekyll seems cool. But seriously, every time after I built the site for whatever reason, I really wish I can have this nice habit to record something both to me and outside world. This time, I had the same wish.

Jekyll is based on github. So it is not as volatile as wordpress, which both Aliyun and tecentYun retracted my server. But if you want to deploy your blogs on wordpress, I would post tutorials later on my blog. And if you like the style of my current blog, give [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a shot.

And this is it. Welcome to my blog.
